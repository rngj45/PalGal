                <p>Patty gave me a call out of the blue. She told me she had done a search on my name and that the state of Illinois was holding substantial money on my behalf. When I found out it was 4,400 I couldn't believe it. I was so happy with PalGal I tipped her 10%. Thanks for looking out Patty! </p>

                    I had totally forgotten about a mortgage payment I made right before I sold my condo. State of Illinois was holding that money. 1,937.00 Thanks for reminding me Patty.

                    We met Patty through mutual friends at a party. Through small talk we learned of her ability to locate unclaimed funds. We were completely surprised to find almost a thousand dollars. Thanks Patty!

                   I have always really watched my money in and out. At least I thought I did. PalGal found four hundred twenty bucks for me. I love you Patty.
